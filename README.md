# Login Page Slicing Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my web slicing project, where I've recreated a login page using HTML and CSS. The design inspiration was sourced from the Figma Community, specifically the design by @2022yanliudesign.

## Overview

This project focuses on converting a design concept into a functional login page using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. The goal is to practice web development skills and gain hands-on experience in translating design into code.

## Design Source

The design used for this project was taken from the Figma Community. The original design was created by @2022yanliudesign. I've taken inspiration from their design to create a responsive and visually appealing login page.

## Features

- Responsive layout for various screen sizes.
- Styled login form with input fields and a submit button.
- Utilization of CSS to achieve the desired visual design.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the login page.
